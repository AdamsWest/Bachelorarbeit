Dear Mr. Koriakin,

at first I want to congratulate you for your outstanding flight with your quadrocopter to an altitude of over 10 km.
My name is Lucas Schreer and I am a student at the university in Brunswick, Germany. I am currently working on my bachelor thesis which includes a performance analysis and the design of small unmanned 
aerial vehicles. To do so, I programmed a small tool to calculate the maximum altitude an UAV (fixed wing or multicopter) is able to reach. 
In order to validate the tool and compare the results to a real climb to that height, my supervisor made me aware of your video. Therefore i am asking you, if you could provide me with all the information you have on that flight.
This would mean a great help for my thesis.  

Spaciba

Yours sincerely

Lucas Schreer
